# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

The Weather Dashboard was a fun challenge to take on from scratch. I had a hard time of figuring out how to get my API's to work, but once I got it to work and understand how to use it, I was excited to see my app grow and obtain the weather data. I ran into a few styling issues as well and I tried to fix everthing by just looking at my code, but I later decided to inspect my web application and that helped me so much. I haven't inspected my page a lot to help me with my styling, but I realized that this is very important to make the page look how I want it to be.
